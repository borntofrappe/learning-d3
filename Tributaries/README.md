# Tributaries

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LINK_TO_LIVE_DEMO_HERE) -->

## Notes

Alternative name: _Rivers. Left, right and center_. It's not relevant for the project, but just a whimsical factoid.

The goal of this D3 project is to highlight the tributaries of two rivers: the [Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine) in France, and the [Po](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(river)#Tributaries>) in Italy. At first the goal was to just practice with the Sankey diagram, but the number of tributaries for the italian basin makes the visual less than feasible.

### Seine — Sankey

Discharge in cubic meters per second.

### Po — Radial

Length in kilometers.
