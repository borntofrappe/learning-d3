# Bar Charts

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Notes

The inspiration for this project comes from [this essay](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/) from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), a publication creating tantalizing data visualizations. The essay studies the _The Office_ with five charts, one of which is an interactive bar chart. From this starting point, I intend to develop at least two bar charts: one analysing the number of lines of dialogues spoken in the series _The Office_, exactly as in the essay, and one considering the victories earned by Formula 1 drivers. In both instances, I plan to focus on accessibility, to have a bar chart informative for screen readers, and transitions, to have the individual bars shuffle following user interaction.

## Data

For the first bar chart, `data` depicts the name, number of lines and episodes for any character with at least ten lines.

For the second bar chart, `data` describes the name, number of race starts and wins for any driver with at least one victory.

_Please note:_ for the second visualization, I decided to consider the number of races where the driver actually started instead of the number of total entries. There is a difference, as some drivers entered a race which they later were not able to start.
