# Radial Paths

With this project I set out to use the functions `d3.lineRadial` and `d3.areaRadial`. A first visualization focuses on creating the radial shape using the two functions and a fixed set of data. Refer to the **Static** folder for such a visualization. A more complex example takes the static example and uses an interval to constantly update the shape according to new input data. The idea is to show only a limited number of observations, and see how the shape of the visualization changes over time.
