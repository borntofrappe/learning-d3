# Random Distribution

With this project I set out to explore the module of the D3 library responsible to produce random data. Random data according to several distributions.

- [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

## Notes

Building the project in increments:

- create an array of data with the normal distribution, starting from a given mean and standard variation

- plot the data with a line function. Highlight the area below the curve with an area function

- show two axes with placeholder text

- highlight the central portion of the curve with an additional area function

- allow to include additional observations by clicking a button

In light of the last step, try to transition between the start and end state.
