## Notes

Here I set out to create a couple of visualizations connected to football. The first analyzes the lackluster success of French teams in the European League competition, while the second wants to show the contribution of the players of the Paris-Saint-Germain team, and in the context of the Champions League competition. The first visualization is set to replicate the visual from [this article from lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/05/04/marseille-club-francais-recordman-des-finales-europeennes-depuis-1980_5294581_4355770.html), while the second is loosely inspired by [this other article from lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/02/16/en-un-graphique-le-parcours-du-psg-en-ligue-des-champions_6070145_4355770.html).

## Squares

The goal is to highlight the highest stage of competition reached by any French team in the European League. This with a series of squares layered on top of each other.
