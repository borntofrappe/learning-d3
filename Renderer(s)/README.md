# Renderer(s)

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

Experiment with a data visualization and different rendering libraries:

- D3

- React

## Notes

For the data visualization, I opted to replicate the bar plot as highlighted in [this study](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-may-2020) on the "Surface air temperature" up to the month of May 2020. The study focuses on a global and european scale, but I chose to focus on the first level only.

It is a rather rudimentary visualization, but one which already allows to consider the advantages of the two rendering libraries.
