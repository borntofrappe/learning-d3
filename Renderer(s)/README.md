# Renderer(s)

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

Plot a data visualization using D3, or a different rendering library.

## Notes

For the data visualization, I opted to replicate the bar plot as highlighted in [this study](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-may-2020) on the "Surface air temperature" up to the month of May 2020.

The page provides the data in a comma separated format, and this is included in the script in the form of a JavaScript array.
