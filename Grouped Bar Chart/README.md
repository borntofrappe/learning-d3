## Notes

An alternative for a [stacked bar chart](), a grouped bar chart maps categories in bars side by side instead of one above the other. You are able to better estimate the value of the individual categories, but cannot estimate the evolution, the overall trend over time. What is more, the visualization becomes cumbersome for large datasets.
