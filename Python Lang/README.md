# Python Lang

Describe the popularity of the Python language with a line chart. Customize the path elements with marker elements.

## Notes

This project builds on top of [this SVG demo](https://github.com/borntofrappe/Front-End-Practice/tree/master/SVG%20Marker) exploring the `<marker>` elements.

## Data

The visualization considers data from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and specifically [the interface](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/) highlighting the number of questions posed on the platform for a given topic. For the python language, see [this query](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python):

```code
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python
```

Stack Overflow maps data from `2008`, but I'm only interested in a subset describing the most recent observations. This allows to keep the attention on the line and the different marker elements.
