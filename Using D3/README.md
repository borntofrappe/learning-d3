# Using D3

This repository relies on the D3 library from start to finish, from concocting the visualizations to mapping the data to HTML elements. It is however possible to use D3 as a utility from other libraries like Svelte or React. The goal of this folder is to illustrate this point, and try to consider the benefits of either solution.

_Please note:_ keeping the spirit of this repository the sub-folders include the demo relying only on D3. In this document I reference other demos from CodePen or again Svelte's own REPL.

## [Line Chart](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/zYdjZYg)

The line chart highlights search interest for the word **Pikmin** in the US, considering data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-01%202021-11-04&geo=US&q=pikmin).

### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/67a634161efd4788871ec3db5cca9181?version=3.44.1)

With respect to the D3-only version the biggest change relates to how the data is mapped to HTML elements. Instead of appending element to D3 selection the nodes are included directly in the DOM.

```svelte
<svg
  viewBox="0 0 {dimensions.width} {dimensions.height}"
  width="{dimensions.width}"
  height="{dimensions.height}"
>
  <path d="{lineGenerator(data)}" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" />
</svg>
```

Svelte allows to rapidly inject the logic in the attributes.

Past this crucial difference the Svelte demo relies on the same functions with one exception: axis. D3 generates the axis, ticks and labels with methods from the `d3-axis` module.

```js
const yAxis = axisLeft(yScale);
```

The functions are called with a selection, like a group element `<g>` and the library directly injects the markup.

```js
groupAxis.append("g").call(yAxis);
```

You can customize the axis from the generator function.

```js
const yAxis = axisLeft(yScale).ticks(4);
```

You can also customize the elements after the fact.

```js
groupAxis.selectAll("line").remove();
```

But fundamentally D3 manages the axis for you. With Svelte you don't have access to the selection object and you need an alternative. In the demo I relied on the `.tick` function available on both linear and time scales.

```js
const yTicks = yScale.ticks(4); // [0 20 40 60 80 100]
```

The function provides an array of intervals separating the domain of the continuous scales.

From this starting point the idea is to use an `#each` block to iterate through the landmarks and add the desired visuals â€” grid lines for the `x` axis and labels for both.

```svelte
{#each yTicks as yTick}
  <g>
  <!-- ticks -->
  </g>
{/each}
```

## [Scatterplot](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/eYErvNa)

The scatterplot maps the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the same natural phenomenon for [Old Faithful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful), a popular geyser in Yellowstone Park.

### [React](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/porVebG)

Similarly to the line chart and the Svelte counterpart, React allows to use the same D3 functions for the scales and axis. What changes is how the markup is produced, with JSX syntax.

To include a collection of elements create an array of elements.

```jsx
const circles = data.map((d, i) => (
  <circle
    cx={xScale(xAccessor(d))}
    cy={yScale(yAccessor(d))}
    r="5"
    fill="currentColor"
    opacity="0.5"
  />
));
```

In the JSX returned by the component it is then possible to include the array directly.

```jsx
return <g>{circles}</g>;
```

Ultimately React raises a warning to include a `key` and differentiate the elements. For the simple project, I find it sufficient to include a short label with the index of the observation.

```jsx
const circles = data.map((d, i) => <circle key={`circle-${i}}`} />);
```

## [Select Histogram](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/LYjmWGN)

The visualization creates and updates a histogram to consider the distribution of one statistic for pokemon of the first generation. The idea is to start with a specific stat and allow to explore other metrics with a `<select>` element.

The interactivity of the project works to illustrate the benefits of a utility or framework much further than previous examples. With only D3 the authoring experience starts to feel disjointed:

- at the top of the script you populate the DOM

- in the body of the `plotMetric` function update the necessary elements

The process is further complicated by the way D3 binds data to the different nodes. The concept of a data join is powerful, but challenging, and in the specific project asks you to differentiate the logic for the group elements describing the bins

```js
const updateGroups = binsGroup.selectAll("g").data(bins);

const enterGroups = updateGroups.enter();
const exitGroups = updateGroups.exit();
```

For the enter selection, new group elements, you append a group element and then nest the necessary visuals.

For the update selection, existing group elements, you update the `transform` property as well as any property of the nested elements which depends on the new values.

For the exit selection, unnecessary group elements, you remove the entire lot.

### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/f6d37364973e48fd9c09ea439c13640d?version=3.44.1)

With Svelte it is enough to rely on reactive declarations to have the change in metric cascade through the DOM.

## [Animated Lollipop](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/gOxzmrX)

Starting from a lollipop chart I first created with Svelte, the project illustrates the flexibility of the `.transition` function and the d3-only solution.

### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/ee1e7ec839ac47f495be12251f04126a?version=3.44.1)

The name of each player is positioned above the corresponding stem. Instead of a circle, the visualization renders a tennis ball using a bit of SVG trickery.

### D3

Instead of plotting the data in static visualizations, the project includes a single `<svg>` and updates the data according to the option selected between two buttons. The animation is included with a series of transition on the enter, update and exit selection, and while the approach works, it also demonstrates my lack of experience with the feature.

At high level, the idea is to animate the enter and update selection together, staggering the individual data points based on their index. If there are elements in the exit selection, however, the idea is to first animate and remove these elements before continuing with the previous combination.

## [Interactive Density Plot](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/KKvGzYL)

The project works to show how D3 manages event like `mouseenter to update the visualization following the reader's interactions. The data points are difficult to select individually, so that the script includes a projection with `d3.Delaunay`. Remove the comments to see how the projection works by layering a series of triangles above the data.

```js
// .attr("stroke", "currentColor")
// .attr("stroke-width", "1")
```

Past the data points, making up a scatterplot, the visualization includes a 2D density plot with the [`d3-contour`](https://github.com/d3/d3-contour) module.

For the data, the script populates an array with a function from [`d3-random`](https://github.com/d3/d3-random) module and specifically [`randomIrvinHall`](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-random#irwinHall). The method is helpful to have a series of points around the center since it receives an argument `n` and tends to concentrate the values around `n/2`. The higher the argument the higher the concetration of the points.

### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/repl/78df67d8be3d4ce0ae29f7ed302a8722?version=3.44.1)

With a tool like Svelte the approach to show, to highlight a data point changes by using the `on:mouseenter` directive.

```svelte
{#each data as d, i}
  <path on:mouseenter={() => { highlight = d }} />
{/each}
```

The difference is quite minimal given the scope of the demo.

Past the interaction, the Svelte demo puts a spotlight on the `.geoPath` function. In the D3-only demo the method is used directly as follows:

```js
contourGroup.join("path").attr("d", geoPathGenerator);
```

The syntax is however a convenience over the longer form.

```js
contourGroup.join("path").attr("d", (d) => geoPathGenerator()(d));
```

D3 implicitly passes the data point to the generator function.
