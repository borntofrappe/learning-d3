# Using D3

[_Fullstack D3_](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3) highlights the D3 library with several data visualizations and argues for different frameworks towards the end of the book. Taking inspiration from this decision, the goal of this folder is to create several visualizations and then re-create the d3-only solution with different utilities, like React and Svelte.
