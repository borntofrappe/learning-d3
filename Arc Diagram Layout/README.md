# Arc Diagram Layout

Add layout attributes on nodes and edges to map network data with an [Arc diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_diagram).

## Data

The script includes data from the exploration of energy sources at European level titled [From where do we import energy?](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html). The arrays refer specifically to the member states of the European Union — `nodes` — and the flow of electricity between countries.
