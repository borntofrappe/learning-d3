# Layered Area Chart

Recreate one of the examples from [datavizproject](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/nested-area-chart/) for a _Layered Area Chart_.

## Data

Google trends looking at world wide interest for the term 'World cup', in four different editions:

- Germany 9 June - 9 July

- South Africa 11 June - 11 July

- Brazil 12 June - 13 July

- Russia 14 June - 15 July

The data looks at the months of June and July, even if the competition sits midpoint.
