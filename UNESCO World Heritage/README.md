# [UNESCO World Heritage](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/jOyRJKO)

With this demo I intend to lean on D3, specifically the `d3-geo` module, and the `topojson` library to map the sites registered by the UNESCO agency as part of the world's heritage.

The data is retrieved from [the UNESCO agency itself](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/).

The design is inspired by [Github.com](https://github.com/) homepage for visitors who are not logged in already.

`unesco.svg` and `world-heritage.svg` are designed to recreate the logos displayed on the UNESCO website.
