# Seine River

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LINK_TO_LIVE_DEMO_HERE) -->

## Notes

Alternative name: _Rivers. Left, right and center_. It's not relevant for the project, but just a whimsical factoid.

The goal of this D3 project is to highlight the tributaries of the Seine river with a couple of visualizations. At first the goal was to just practice with a Sankey diagram, but the hierarchical nature of the dataset inspired me to explore the shapes from the `d3-hierarchy` module.
