# Most Celebrated F1 Drivers

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/MWbqLYM)

## Notes

The inspiration for this project comes from [this essay](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/) from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), a publication creating tantalizing data visualizations. The essay studies the _The Office_ with five charts, one of which is an interactive bar chart. From this starting point, I intend to develop a bar chart highlighting the most celebrated drivers in the F1 championship according to the number of wins.

_Please note:_ the folder actually includes two visualizations, as I first tried to replicate the exact visual proposed in the cited essay.

_Please also note:_ for the F1 races, I decided to consider the number of races where the driver actually started instead of the number of total entries. There is a difference, as some drivers entered a race which they later were not able to start.
