# Faux 3D D3

Use SVG elements to fake three dimensional visualizations.

## Bars

In the **Bars** folder find a proof of concept for the bar chart. The pie chart was first created in the **Data Practice** project.

## Data

For the data consider the [top selling title sales units for the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html).

## Update

Next to the name and value of each data point, I've added the release date as detailed by [Nintendo on their official website](https://www.nintendo.com/games/game-guide/?pv=true). It'd be teaching to plot the unit sold per day, so to analyse how the dates impact the top ten positions.
