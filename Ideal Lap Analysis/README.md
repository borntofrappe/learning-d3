# Ideal Lap Analysis

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

A recent article [on the F1 website](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.5-things-we-learned-from-friday-practice-at-the-qatar-grand-prix.77yVf82ZjGfBNa5SnBCi5B.html) analysing the Friday practice session for the Qatar Grand Prix describes the ideal lap with a few visualizations. The goal of this project is to first create the visualization and second gather them in a single dashboard.

### Dotplot

The first type of chart is a variation of a lollipop chart, itself a variation of a barplot. Instead of bars, instead of lines culminating in circles, the idea is to plot only the circles at the coordinate specified by the lap time.

### Barplot

The more conventional bar plot highlights the gap to the ideal lap.
