# Perception of Probability

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

A post on [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumOneCatSeveralObs.html) illustrates how to analyse a dataset with numerical and categorical variables with different types of visualizations, among which a box plot and a violin plot. The goal of this project is to replicate the concepts introduced in the article, but also replicate the visualizations [I first created with Python](https://replit.com/@borntofrappe/Perception-of-probability) and several `.py` libraries focused on data science â€” `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
