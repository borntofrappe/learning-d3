# Atmospheric Composition

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/rNzvvLE)

## Notes

With this project I want to consider the composition of the atmosphere of several celestial bodies with a good-looking half-a-donut chart and an informative legend.

Inspiration comes from [highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com), a charting library which shows a similar concept in the landing page (you might need to select "Developers" and "Style with CSS").

Data is slightly modified considering the information from Wikipedia for the selected bodies.
