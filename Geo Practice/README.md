# Geo Practice

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

The `d3-geo` module allows to map data to geographies. The goal of this project folder is to create several visualizations to rehearse the possibilities introduced by the repository.

### [World Atlas](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/gOxQXRK)

The goal is to render the world according to a hard-coded projection. The project introduces data from the `world-atlas` module and `topojson` to convert the data from topoJSON to geoJSON, the format expected by `d3-geo`.

### Antipodes

Building on top of `World Atlas` the demo illustrates how a projection can be modified to show different sides of the same geography.
