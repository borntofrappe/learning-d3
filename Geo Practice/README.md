# Geo Practice

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

The `d3-geo` module allows to map data to geographies. The goal of this project folder is to create several visualizations to rehearse the possibilities introduced by the repository.

### World Atlas

In the first demo the goal is to render the world according to a hard-coded projection. The project introduces data from the `world-atlas` module and `topojson` to convert the data from topoJSON to geoJSON, the format expected by `d3-geo`.
