# Eurovision Votes

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LINK_TO_LIVE_DEMO_HERE) -->

## Notes

The goal of this project is to recreate a couple of visualizations from [this interesting analysis](https://googletrends.github.io/eurosearch-19/) of the Google trends for the Eurovision song contest, and specifically the Sankey diagram and the scatterplot highlighting the connection between two metrics.

I'd like to focus on the split between the two types of votes, from professional juries and the public, and on the 2021 edition. Data is collected from the [wikipedia page of the contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2021#Final_2). The [official Eurovision website](https://eurovision.tv/about/voting) explains how voting takes place.
