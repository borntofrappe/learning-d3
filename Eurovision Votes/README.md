## Notes

[Google Trends](https://googletrends.github.io/eurosearch-19/) analyses the 2019 edition of the Eurovision song contest in terms of results and search activity. Here I want to replicate a couple of visualizations from the article, like the Sankey diagram highlighting the rankings and the scatter plot to consider the correlation between votes and searh results. Instead of the 2019 edition, I want to focus on the 2021 contest. In place of Google searches, I want to highlight the difference between the types of voting in the competition.

Data is collected from the [wikipedia page of the contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2021#Final_2).
