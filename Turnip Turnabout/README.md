## Data

Following [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-20%202020-05-17&q=turnip) consider the search interest between the 20th of January and the 17th of May.

The 20th of March is took as a frame of reference since it coincides with the release date of the Nintendo game Animal Crossing. The title has a unique impact on the searches for the particular word.

## Visualizations

With a line chart, plot the interest across the chosen timeframe.

With a couple of radial line charts, describe how the interest varies in the timeframe of a week. Do so considering the dates before and then after the 20th of March.
