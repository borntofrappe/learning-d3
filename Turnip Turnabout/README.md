## Data

Following [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-20%202020-05-17&q=turnip) consider the search interest between the 20th of January and the 17th of May. This to have the 20th of March roughly as a mid point, and consider a full week period (begins on Monday, ends on Sunday).

The 20th of March is took as a frame of reference since it coincides with the release date of the Nintendo game Animal Crossing. This title has a unique impact on the searches for the particular word.

## lineRadial

Past the line chart, use a radial line chart to highlight how the interest changes in the timeframe of a week. Plot two charts to consider the values before and after the arbitrary date.
