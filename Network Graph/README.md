# Network Graph

Recreate [this inspiring demo](https://observablehq.com/@d3/build-your-own-graph?collection=@d3/d3-force) with a dynamic network graph.

## Notes

In a previous project (see **Force Simulation**), I used the `d3-force` module to set up a simulation, without specifying any force. This was on purpose, but I would be remiss if I were to skip that important section of the library.
