# Data Join

The project introduces the enter-update-exit pattern, and considers how `select.join()` might improve the often complicated syntax.

## Teaching

Consider explaining the project while creating a game of bingo. For instance, creating an array of numbers in the `[1, 75]` range, picking the values one at a time and highlighting only the last `n` choices.
