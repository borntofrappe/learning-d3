# Data Join

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/wvaxwdY)

## Notes

The project introduces the enter-update-exit pattern, and considers how `select.join()` might improve the often complicated syntax.

The documentation introduces the function in the [d3-selection](github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md) module.
