# Cumulative CO2 Emissions

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

[lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/11/06/cop26-visualisez-les-emissions-cumulees-de-dioxyde-de-carbone-par-pays-depuis-1850_6101202_4355770.html) recently published a striking visualization on cumulative CO2 emissions, ranked by countries from 1850 up to 2021. The concept is taken directly from an article from [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change). 

The goal of this project is to replicate the visualization, animating the bar chart to change the size, position and text of the different entries with each passing year.
