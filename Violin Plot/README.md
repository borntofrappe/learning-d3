# Violin Plot

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

A violin plot allows to plot numerical data and focus on the distribution of said numerical data. It is similar to a box plot, but highlights the distribution by plotting a curve with a _kernel density estimation_. The goal of this project is to explore the topic and how to implement such a visualization with D3.
