# Violin Plot

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

A violin plot allows to plot numerical data and focus on the distribution of said numerical data. It is similar to a box plot, but highlights the distribution by plotting a curve with a _kernel density estimation_. The goal of this project is to explore the topic and how to implement such a visualization with D3.

_Please note:_ I first experimented with violin plots with Python and different `.py` libraries focused on data science such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. You can find the demo [on replit](https://replit.com/@borntofrappe/Perception-of-probability).
