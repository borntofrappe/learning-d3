# Spaghetti Plot

<!-- ## [Live Demo](LIVE_DEMO_URL) -->

## Notes

When a line chart plots multiple variables it is often described as a [spaghetti plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spaghetti.html). The term is discouraging, as it becomes more difficult to parse the information and the effectiveness of the line chart diminishes.

With this project the goal is to immediately recreate the plot highlighting ten variables and then try to cope with its shortcomings. This is achieved in at least two ways:

- allow to toggle the variable on and off

- plot the variables in individual, dedicated line charts, or area charts
