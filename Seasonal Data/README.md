## Notes

[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=sun,moon) highlights an interesting pattern in search interest for the keywords sun and moon and the last twelve months. The goal of this project is to immediately recreate the line chart and then repurpose the information with a small animation, playing on the following keywords: sunrise and sunset, moon phases.
