Plot the trends in Google search for the term "turnip", highlighting the searches in the timeframe of a week.

## Data

Following [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-20%202020-05-17&q=turnip) consider the search values for the word "turnip" between the 20th of January and the 17th of May. This to have the 20th of March roughly as a mid point, and consider a full week period (begins on Monday, ends on Sunday).

The 20th of March is took as a frame of reference since it coincides with the release date of the Nintendo game Animal Crossing. This title has a unique impact on the searches for the particular word.

## Visualizations

- a line chart plotting the data on two axis

- a radial chart considering the average and plotting the data above/below this defining line

Tally up the values for the days of the week. Consider plotting two visualizations: before and after the week of the 20th of March. Consider using the 16th since this is a Monday.
