# Proportional Area Chart

Recreate one of the examples from [datavizproject](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/proportional-area-chart-half-circle/) for a _Proportional Area Chart (Half Circle)_.

## Data

The script includes sales figures from bulbapedia. To have some kind of comparison between values I focused on figures for the units sold in Japan and the first week. Each data point includes units sold and _sell-through_ rate, meaning the percentage sold by retailers out of units shipped.
